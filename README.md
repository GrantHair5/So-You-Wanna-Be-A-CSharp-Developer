# So-You-Wanna-Be-A-CSharp-Developer
A bunch of us got together and came up with some stuff that we wish we would have known at the beginning of our careers as C# devs.

## Why C#

I personally believe that C# is pretty awesome because it can both read and write as plain english. I often look at some programming languages and find it pretty difficult to decipher exactly what is going on (yes i am looking at you C++). 

Lets look at this Hello World in C# for example and admire its simplistic beauty

```csharp
// C# program to print Hello World!
using System;
  
// namespace declaration
namespace HelloWorldApp {
      
    // Class declaration
    class Hello {
          
        // Main Method
        static void Main(string[] args) {
             
            // printing Hello World! to console
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}

```

Now if you compare that to esoteric languages then you are onto a winner

C# has been designed to be easy to learn, fun to learn and also extremely powerful. 

Before I began my job as a C# Developer I hadn't written a single line of C# code, I hadn't even opened Visual Studio or really knew what it was but honestly for me it was a very nice learning experience and you quickly see yourself beginning to really ramp up your knowledge and then next thing you know you are off on your own building crazy mad apps. 

Also if you ever get angry during your time learning C# just know the inventor of C# is on Twitter https://twitter.com/ahejlsberg 

We will try and fit in some kind of structure to this repo but in all honesty that is a lie and it will probably become a massive spaghetti clusterf*ck that will eventually eat up all my free time and also drain my soul as I slowly realise I actually know nothing at all. 

But anyways I hope this will be of help to someone and please feel free to fork and open PR's for anything you think weve missed, any help is hugely appreciated.
